- Built the first ever comprehensive dataset of 2M+ alcohol retailers around the U.S. to be used in a CDC-funded project evaluating the causal effect of the alcohol use on firearm violence
- Reduced data cleaning time from 3 days to 1 hour per state by designing R scripts to process raw alcohol retailer data using regex expressions and dplyr
- Mapped county-level disparities in income, education, and demographics using R to support causal research on whether policies restricting firearm access near alcohol-serving venues reduce gun violence

- Influenced stakeholders to increase the sample size in future Safeco Insurance marketing experiments, ensuring 80% statistical power to reliably detect improvements in conversion rates
- Evaluated an experiment launched to 100K customers that measured the effectiveness of various marketing tactics used in the Safeco Insurance Prospecting Program by analyzing key business metrics such as quote and conversion rates in Excel
- Applied bootstrapping to generate 70% confidence intervals, improving the accuracy of estimated quote and conversion rates from a small sample size using Python
- Built a SQL query that joined Safeco Prospecting Program data from a vendor with Liberty Mutualâ€™s quote and issue data using fuzzy-matching techniques, identifying 60% more prospects compared to the previous method
