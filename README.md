## Welcome!
Hi, I'm Kevin, a 4th year Statistics major at UCLA. I'm interested in gaining experience in designing and analyzing experiments and applying causal inference techniques to measure product launches and marketing campaigns.

    <strong>Data Analyst Intern @ Capital One</strong> (Jun 2025 - Present)
    <br>
    • Reduced retrieval time of historical credit bureau reports from minutes to seconds by onboarding a monitoring SQL script to an internal platform, improving report accessibility for stakeholders managing 60K+ daily customer cases
    <br>
    • Established an auditable, documented script review process, by registering the script to a governance platform, eliminating fragmented communication between the data analyst and credit bureau disputes teams
    <br>
    • Prevented data-syncing issues that would have resulted in inaccurate results for 3 daily reports used by the credit bureau disputes team by identifying upstream data changes and correcting the reporting scripts on Databricks

    <strong>Undergraduate Research @ UCLA Fielding School of Public Health</strong> (March 2025 - Present)
    <br>
    • Built a comprehensive, nationwide dataset of 2M+ alcohol retailers as part of a CDC-funded research initiative, supporting an analysis evaluating the effectiveness of firearm-restricting policies across 3K+ counties
    <br>
    • Reduced data cleaning time from 1 day to 3 hours per state by designing data preprocessing scripts using R, and created clear onboarding documentation for new student researchers
    <br>
    • Mapped county-level disparities in income, education, and demographics using R to support research on whether policies restricting firearm access near alcohol-serving venues reduce gun violence

  <div>
    <strong>Data Analyst Intern @ Liberty Mutual Insurance</strong> (June 2024 - August 2024)
    <br>
    • Analyzed conversion rates from a 100K-customer marketing experiment using SQL and convinced Marketing to increase the sample size of future experiments, improving the chance of detecting meaningful conversion rate lifts to 80%
    <br>
    • Quantified uncertainty in conversion rate estimates by creating 70% bootstrap confidence intervals using Python, helping stakeholders recognize the inconclusive findings and avoid incorrect interpretations of the results of the experiment
    <br>
    • Built a SQL query that joined Safeco Prospecting Program data from a vendor with Liberty Mutual's internal data using fuzzy-matching techniques, identifying ∼ 60% more prospects compared to the previous method
