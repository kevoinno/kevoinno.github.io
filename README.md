## Welcome!
Hi, I'm Kevin, a 3rd year Statistics major at UCLA. I'm interested in gaining experience in running and analyzing experiments and applying causal inference techniques to drive important decisions in product and marketing. 

Contact me at kevoinngo@ucla.edu

### Technical Skills
**Tools:** Jupyter, VS Code, Git, Tableau, PowerBI, SAS, Excel  
**Languages:** Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn), R, SQL, SAS

### Education 
B.S., Statistics & Data Science | University of California, Los Angeles (June 2026)

### Work Experience  

**Undergraduate Research @ UCLA Fielding School of Public Health (March 2025 - Present)**
- Built the first ever comprehensive dataset of 2M+ alcohol retailers around the U.S. to be used in a CDC-funded project evaluating the causal effect of the alcohol use on firearm violence
- Reduced data cleaning time from 3 days to 1 hour per state by designing R scripts to process raw alcohol retailer data using regex expressions and dplyr
- Mapped county-level disparities in income, education, and demographics using R to support causal research on whether policies restricting firearm access near alcohol-serving venues reduce gun violence

**Data Science Intern @ Liberty Mutual Insurance (June 2024 - August 2024)**  
- Influenced stakeholders to increase the sample size in future Safeco Insurance marketing experiments, ensuring 80% statistical power to reliably detect improvements in conversion rates
- Evaluated an experiment launched to 100K customers that measured the effectiveness of various marketing tactics used in the Safeco Insurance Prospecting Program by analyzing key business metrics such as quote and conversion rates in Excel
- Applied bootstrapping to generate 70% confidence intervals, improving the accuracy of estimated quote and conversion rates from a small sample size using Python
- Built a SQL query that joined Safeco Prospecting Program data from a vendor with Liberty Mutualâ€™s quote and issue data using fuzzy-matching techniques, identifying 60% more prospects compared to the previous method

### Projects

[TicketTrail (In Progress)](https://github.com/kevoinno/concert-prices) 
A website that will help me and users save money on concert tickets! Users will be able to track specific concerts and see the historical prices of that concert. Then there will be some predictive modeling to suggest to the users when it is a good time to buy the tickets.

[DrakeRecs | Python (streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn), Youtube Data API](https://github.com/kevoinno/drake-recommendations)  
Web app that recommends Drake songs to users based on Drake songs that they already like.  

[Youtube Video Analytics | Python (streamlit, pandas, plotly), Youtube Data API, Statistics)](https://github.com/kevoinno/youtube-analytics)  
Web app that displays basic statistics about trending YouTube videos. Automated a script that updates and displays data (not active anymore).
