## Welcome!
Hi, I'm Kevin, a 3rd Statistics & Data Science major at UCLA. I'm interested in gaining experience in running and analyzing experiments and applying causal inference techniques. 

### Technical Skills
Tools: Jupyter, VS Code, Git, Tableau, PowerBI, SAS, Excel
Languages: Python, R, SQL 

### Education 
- B.S., Statistics & Data Science | University of California, Los Angeles (June 2026)

### Work Experience  
**Data Science Intern @ Liberty Mutual Insurance (June 2024 - August 2024)**  
- Influenced stakeholders to increase the control group’s sample size in future Safeco Prospecting Program experiments,
raising the statistical power to 80% for more accurate detection of conversion rate improvements.  
- Evaluated an experiment that measured the effectiveness of different marketing tactics used in the Safeco Insurance
Prospecting Program by analyzing key business metrics such as quote and conversion rates in Excel.  
- Applied bootstrapping to generate 70% confidence intervals, improving the accuracy of estimated quote and conversion
rates from a small sample size using Python.  
- Built a SQL query that joined Safeco Prospecting Program data from a vendor with Liberty Mutual’s quote and issue
data using fuzzy-matching techniques, identifying 109 more prospects compared to the previous method.
